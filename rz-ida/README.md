# rz-ida

This tool facilitates the import of metadata from the IDA Pro to use inside Rizin.
It supports the parsing of the `*.idb` files and `*.idc` exported scripts.

**Note:** This requires the [python-idb](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-idb) installed
and available for python imports.

It is recommended to use the latest version from the PyPI:
```sh
pip3 install -U --user python-idb
```
